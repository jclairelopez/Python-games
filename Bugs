1) Homebrew didn't want to install on my machine. Gave me an error that the environment is out of date and I will run into errors and 
have to trouble shoot on my own.

2) Attempting to update my OS from Yosemite 10.10 to El Capitan. Used the terminal to check to find out whether the Darwin kernel 
at the core of OS X is currently running in a 64-bit processor space with this code:

Uname -a

Returned a long line of text displaying the name of the current operating system. Text included the item x86_64.
(If x86_64 is not present, then you won’t be able to run the new version of OS X)

Checked to see if my EFI firmware is also a 64-bit version with this code:
ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree -l |grep firmware-abi

Returned type of EFI firmware my Mac is using. Text includes the phrase EFI64
(If it says EFI32, then you won’t be able to upgrade.)

3) Attempting a clean install of El Capitan. 
Requires back up of my files. 
Exploring Time Machine because I've only been manually saving items in Google drive.
